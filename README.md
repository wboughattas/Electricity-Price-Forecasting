# Electricity-Price-Forecasting
This repository is forked from a gitlab repository (originally made for a 3-day hackathon). 
The goal of the fork is to improve the code to practice machine learning, 
database management, and python development.

The new modifications will improve:
- Data collection
- Data manipulation
- Data storage management
- Model calibration (existing: XGBoost)
- Introduction of new machine learning models
